    <h5>What is Daily Calorie Intake?</h5>
    <p>
      Caloric intake is defined as the amount of energy consumed via food and beverage. Calories are units that measure the energy in food; as well as, the energy produced, stored, and utilized by living organisms. Most people only associate calories with food and drink, but anything that contains energy has calories. One kilogram (1 kg) of coal, for example, contains 7,000,000 calories. 
      <br/><br/>
      The human body needs calories to survive. Your body is able to break down food molecules and use the stored energy for many different functions, including movement, thought and growth. Calories also play a role in weight control, because eating more calories than your body needs can lead to weight gain.
      <br/><br/>
      There are two types of calories:
      <br/><br/>
      a. A <b> small calorie (cal)</b> is the amount of energy required to raise the temperature of 1 gram (g) of water by 1º Celsius (º C).
      <br/><br/>
      b. A <b> large calorie (kcal) </b> is the amount of energy required to raise 1 kilogram (kg) of water by 1º C. It is also known as a kilocalorie.
      1 kcal is equal to 1,000 cal.
      <br/><br/>
      The terms <b> “large calorie” </b> and <b> “small calorie” </b> are often used interchangeably. This is misleading. The calorie content described on food labels refers to kilocalories. A 250-calorie chocolate bar actually contains 250,000 calories.

  <h5>Why is it important to know your Daily Calorie Intake?</h5>
    <p>
      If people consumed only the number of calories needed every day, they would probably have healthy lives. Calorie consumption that is too low or too high will eventually lead to health problems. The number of calories in food tells us how much potential energy they contain.
      <br/><br/>
      Furthermore, extreme calorie restriction affects your health and your ability to lose weight. Low calorie intake reduces the amount of food you can eat and may prevent you from getting all necessary nutrients. Research shows that calorie restriction reduces leptin, a hormone that helps to regulate appetite. Low levels of leptin can lead to hunger and overeating. 
      <br/><br/>
      Research also shows that low-calorie dieting increases stress and the release of the stress hormone, cortisol. As a result of this stress response, the body conserves energy and the metabolism slows to combat the risk of starvation. While you might think that drastically cutting calories is sure to result in weight loss, these changes in stress levels are actually associated with weight gain.

 <h5>What is the minimum Daily Calorie intake required per individual?</h5>
  <p>
     As a general rule, people need a minimum of 1,200 calories daily to stay healthy. People who have a strenuous fitness routine or perform many daily activities need more calories. If you have reduced your calorie intake below 1,200 calories a day, you could be hurting your body in addition to your weight-loss plans.
     <br/><br/>
     However, the United States government states that the average man needs 2,700 kcal per day and the average woman needs 2,200 kcal per day. Not everybody needs the same number of calories each day. People have different metabolisms that burn energy at different rates, and some people have more active lifestyles than others.
     <br/><br/>
     The recommended intake of calories per day depends on 6 several factors which are:
     <br/><br/>
     1. Overall general health
     <br/><br/>
     2. Physical activity demands
     <br/><br/>
     3. Sex 
     <br/><br/>
     4. Weight
     <br/><br/>
     5. Height
     <br/><br/>
     6. Body shape
