<h1> App Software </h1>
  <p> This app was developed using Stackblitz, a free and easy online software developing program tool. </p>
<br/><br/>
<br/><br/>
<h1> How to use the app? </h1>
  <p> Using this app is very simple. In the home page, company vision, mission, and details regarding daily calories are discussed and presented. The details shown would give the users background on calories and how to balance them so that they can live a healthier life. To use the calculator, simply head to the calculator tab, read and follow the instructions, input all necessary information, and press "CALCULATE" once done. </p>
<br/><br/>
<br/><br/>
<br/><br/>
<h1> Formula for Daily Calorie Intake </h1>
  <p> The calculator is based on the Mifflin-St. Jeor equation which is a formula that shows an accurate way of estimating calorie needs in both men and women. 
  <br/><br/>
    <b>For Men: </b> BMR = (10 x weight in kg) + (6.25 × height in cm) - (5 × age in years) + 5
      <br/><br/>
      <b>For Women: </b> BMR = (10 x weight in kg) + (6.25 × height in cm) - (5 × age in years) - 161
   </p>
